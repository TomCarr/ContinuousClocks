# ContinuousClocks

Estimates of substitution rates from molecular sequence data are strongly influenced by assumptions. This is because the substitution rate along each branch is not identifiable i.e. the likelihood depends on a product of the rate and time along each branch. Often the assumptions we use in relaxed clock models are difficult to justify.  

Some continuous traits (for example longevity) are known to be associated with molecular substitution rates. Continuous traits are also useful because they retain a consistent phylogenetic signal regardless of the rate at which they evolve - i.e. they do not become saturated (Parins-Fukuchi 2018)[https://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syx072]. 

These models are designed to use these useful characteristics of continuous traits as a means to estimate substitution rates and divergence times.
